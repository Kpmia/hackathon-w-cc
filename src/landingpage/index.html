      <div id="ninsidecontainer">
        <p style="font-size:19px;">In the male-dominated world of startups, many female founders and entrepreneurs think the same question: “But what if I’m not taken seriously by investors?”<br><br>
          This question is not uncommon for a reason. In 2018, only 3% of venture capital in the U.S. went towards companies led by a female CEO. No wonder 55% of women second-guess their decision to start a business. 
            <br><br>
            Talented, driven women across the world face the same dilemma of doubting their abilities to successfully lead and pitch their ideas due to inherent bias in the VC industry. <br><br>
